# ðŸš€ untype

Untype is a monorepo containing a variety of convenient tools for creating full-stack TypeScript applications. All these tools have proven their effectiveness in real-world projects with extensive codebases and heavy workloads. These solutions and approaches have similar counterparts, yet they significantly differ from them in their operational principles and ease of use.

## ðŸ”¥ Examples

-   [fullstack-example](./projects/fullstack-example) - Example of a full-stack application using `@untype/rpc`, `@untype/orm`, `@untype/worker`, `@untype/config`, `@untype/logger`, `@untype/dumper`, `@untype/migrations`, `@untype/pg`, `@untype/geo`, `@untype/rpc-react`, `@untype/rpc-express`.
